/*
* This file is provided for application-specific style rules.
*
* By default, Maqetta includes this CSS file within HTML pages
* authored in Maqetta.
*
* This file is typically used to override style rules found in
* theme CSS files. For example, suppose the theme CSS file has:
*
* .claro .dijitButton .dijitButtonNode {
*		padding:2px 4px 4px 4px;
* }
*
* But for your application suppose you want to tighten the padding
* for buttons. Then, you might include the following style rule
* in this file (assuming that you accept Maqetta's default where
* id "myapp" is present on the BODY element, and assuming
* that you are using the "claro" theme):
*
* #myapp.claro .dijitButton .dijitButtonNode {
*		padding:1px 3px 3px 3px;
* }
*
* Because of CSS precedence rules (see [1]), the above style rule
* (which begins with #myapp.claro) will "win the cascade" versus 
* the style rule from the theme CSS file due to the use of the
* ID select (#myapp), which has higher specificity than the class
* selectors used throughout the Claro theme.
